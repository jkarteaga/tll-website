_The Liberation League_ is a grassroots civil rights organisation established in Pune, India, dedicated to advocate for the causes of social justice and social equality between (but not limited to) all genders, races, castes, class, and species. 

## Mission

The Liberation League wishes to forge the revolution of the Twenty First century, one which seeks to dismantle all forms of existing social inequalities, social hierarchies and power systems including the oppression of nonhuman persons, and the domination of Earth. 

Comprising of social justice advocates from various backgrounds and perspectives, we undertake educational projects at the grassroots level to educate the masses about existing social injustices and  disenfranchisement of marginalised groups and to create new mechanisms to fight for true liberation from oppressive social hierarchies. 

We wish to build a movement for liberation that acknowledges the hierarchical interconnectedness between the oppression of social disadvantaged groups, the commonalities between various systems of power and how they interact to maintain various networks of privileges,i,e, unmerited benefits given to a group of people who belong to a particular social group, resulting in institutionalised social inequality between various groups. 



Inequality is made possible, is a socially created body, a function rather than a biological or 'natural' phenomenon; a lot of intellectual labour and scrutiny has gone behind making oppression seem like a natural state of affairs. Criterion like species, race, gender, sex, ability or age are irrelevant for the determination of allocation of resources, rights and value, yet these factors have been heavily relied on by dominant groups to mark themselves from those unlike them and to forcefully disallow such groups from holding institutional power, leading to oppressive practices, ideas and homogenisation of disadvantaged groups. 



It is to be recognised that our mainstream social justice movements operate on these invisible social hierarchies, the very same systems that create oppressive and violent  attitudes. 

<!-- # \\*\\*First Principles\\*\\* -->

### The Personal is the Political or The Private is the Political

We recognise that individual or personal experiences are connected to larger political and social structures and that only social change and dismantling systemic forms of oppression is the key for total liberation.

### Intersectional Feminist Theory - Black Feminist Theory

We support and recognise the analytical framework provided by legal scholar and race theorist **KimberleÃÅ Crenshaw** on gender construction and its relation to race and other social factors in her work Mapping the _Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color_.
<br><br>
The Liberation League rejects the single axis frameworks adopted by mainstream social justice movements which ignores the experiences of those at the intersection of systems of oppressions.

### Social Construction as the basis of Disadvantage, Disability and Privilege

We believe that the manner in which society is organised and valuation of abilities, capabilities, interests and other characteristics is the cause for the existing disadvantages and disabilities faced by marginalised groups, and not inherent biological or anthropological factors.

### Recognising 'Privilege'

_Privilege_ is a set of unearned advantages or benefits given to a certain social group, who possess characteristics, capabilities, traits valued by the dominant classes and we believe that recognition of privilege and breaking the network of privilege is the first step towards total liberation.

### Veganism is a Moral Imperative

Besides a category of animals who receive statutory protection in our laws, non-human animals are the 'property' of human beings, and hence, can be bred and used for commercial purposes. Animals being considered human property accords them only instrumental value, and does not account for their own intrinsic moral worth. Animals who exist to serve as human resources are offered little protection under the law and have no moral consideration of their own and instead exist as a means to an end and not ends in themselves. To take the actual interests of animals into account, they must be declared as living persons with the right not to be owned by others and to exist as independent beings of moral worth.
<br><br>
The Liberation League exists to advocate for interests of non- human persons by means of educational _Anti - Speciesism_ advocacy and by promoting _veganism_.

### Total Liberation

Anti-Oppression advocacy and dialogue between people of diverse backgrounds is necessary to break the effects of the _otherisation_ of marginalised groups, and to achieve _total liberation_.
