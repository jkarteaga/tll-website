  The plight of nonhuman animals has become a tool for both the parties of the

  the exploitation of the nonhuman animals.

Recently, Feminism In India, a renowned intersectional feminist organization, published an article on the issue of ‘cow vigilantism’, addressing the mob lynching and rising crimes against women and minorities. Even though the article raised some important issues, it did by appropriating someone else’s issues. 

**Here’s the link to the article:** [https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/03/cow-vigilantism-lynching/

This response is in regards to the appropriation and single-issue campaign advocacy of the article. As we know, single-issue campaigns never serve the purpose of dismantling oppression; instead, they reinforce the hierarchical oppressive framework created by the supremacist patriarchal system.In some ways, they also project the false either-or approach to social justice. Therefore, it is necessary for the social justice advocates to not appropriate others’ issues and step over those to speak of another issue, if our motive is complete liberation, because no one is free until everyone is free.

The very beginning of this article holds its foundation on appropriation. It brings up the issue of cows and how the CM of UP “wages a battle to protect the mother of the nation”, but it fails to address the issues of cows who are being exploited in dairy, leather, and beef industries; it fails to address the forceful impregnation of cows and separation of these cows from their new-born child; it fails to address the killings and discarding of male caves; it fails to address the exploitation of the cows and bulls based on their reproductive abilities.

The CM of UP and the “GauRakshaks” are not waging any battle for the protection of the cows or any other nonhuman animals. Everyone knows their hypocrisy. Having said that, there is a clear case of appropriation as the article uses the issue of cows as its basis to develop and highlight the issues of women, which is another issue of great concern. However, the other way around would have not been acceptable at all.

Yogi, _“raising his voices”_, against the heinous crimes against “gaumata” is a case of hypocrisy and other reasons mentioned in the article. The likes of him are not doing anything for the protection of the cows. The reason why people are still enjoying milk, ghee, butter, curd, paneer, and India being one of the largest producers and exporters of dairy, beef, and leather, says it all. These products would not be possible to produce without exploiting the “gaumata” to an unimaginable extent. For the second time, the article appropriates the issue of cows to state the ‘deafening silence when it comes to sexual assault against women’. It ignores, instead appropriates, the sexual exploitation of cows to highlight the issue of human women. The sexually exploited cows have only become a reference point by the complete erasure of them, their exploitation, and experience. It is the case of ‘absent referent’ as discussed by Carol J. Adams in her book _The Sexual Politics of Meat._

The article claims that “as crimes against women rise, more attention is instead given to protection of the cows,” but it never realizes the “attention” does not protect the thousands of cows who are sexually exploited for milk. Why does the article find it necessary to compare the exploitation of two oppressed groups while complain only about who is getting more attention, instead of speaking out against the oppressive system? The exploitation of cows _(and other nonhuman animals)_ has always been on an all-time high and no one bothers about them for they have been assigned the commodity status. 

Since the nonhuman animals have been assigned the commodity status, any form or degree of exploitation inflicted on them remains unquestionable and justified, because “commodities” don’t have moral values. It also talks about cow being the symbol of motherhood and femininity. Yet, it forgets to highlight how the feminization and role assignment have given an approval to the exploitation of these cows.

It clearly uses the phrase “…Muslims and Dalits who traditionally skin the carcass of cows” yet it fails to see the exploitation of the nonhuman animals and how other oppressed human groups are made to do the job of exploiting another nonhuman oppressed community. It fails to see how the upper caste and dominant group have put all the oppressed groups (Muslims, Dalits, and cows) in a pit of exploitation, where they all get exploited for the benefit of the dominant group.

The article talks about using feminization of cows as a tactic similar to feminization of the nation and how it has become grounds to legitimize attacks on minorities to consolidate the power of upper caste Hindu men. It sees how cows are feminized and used as a tool to attack minorities, but it fails to see the exploitation of cows and use of cows as a political tool. It fails to see how the power play of the upper caste Hindu men affects all oppressed groups, including cows_ (and other nonhuman animals)_.

The instances of using cows for sacrifice and how that offers a property status to the cows, are quite impossible to miss, yet the article reduces it just to a reference material to bring up the hypocrisy of Hinduism. The article points out the use of cows in casteism, sexism, and religion-based discrimination, yet it fails to see the use of cows as a ‘political tool’ that only ends up in getting exploited in the hands of humans. 

At one point, the article literally reduces the cows to just mere properties that are “stolen” from Muslims and “given” to Hindus, while claiming the nonhuman animals to be a “crucial source of income”. It clearly misses how the cows are used as a tool of exploitation by the powerful humans and used as a tool to make income by the less powerful humans. In both the cases, these cows get exploited too, but the only exploitation that the article points out is that of poor people losing their “source of income” (which, indeed, is also an issue).

Towards the end, it speaks of ‘masculinity’ and how a Hindu man defines it as an “ability to protect what is his birthright and his mother”. Cows are not the birthright of the Hindu man; they are not the Hindu man’s properties.The very idea of considering nonhuman animals as human’s properties reinforces the supremacist patriarchal ideology.The article notices how the cows are feminized and mothered, yet it fails to see how feminizing the cows contributes to their exploitation and how assigning the role of a mother exploits nonhuman animals _(here, cows)_ for their milk.

In the whole attempt to advocate for the exploitation of women and human minorities, the article jumps into the single-issue campaign bandwagon and appears to be an exclusionary movement that steps over the issues of another oppressed group – the nonhuman animals. It follows the same supremacist framework of one being more important/valuable than and superior to another based on a morally irrelevant difference (here, species). One thing we have learned from the historical justice movements is that we can’t achieve liberation if we keep excluding members of other oppressed groups because All Oppression Is Connected. We need to realize that “animal” is a status assigned to anyone who is considered “less than” or exploitable because of the false human-animal dichotomy that humans have created. It also results from the blatantly disregarded exploitation of nonhuman animals because they have been assigned the commodity status, making them the “source” of human benefits, rejecting their individuality and interests. In our attempt to fight oppression, like AphKo, _a theorist, founder of Black Vegans Rock, and co-author of Aphro-ism: Essays on Pop Culture, Feminism, and Black Veganism from Two Sisters_, said, “Being a member of an oppressed class does not exempt you from being oppressive to others. We should refrain from getting too comfortable talking only of our own specific oppression.”

With the expectation that the organization follows an ethically consistent anti-oppression framework in their advocacy, we are looking forward to a response to why the appropriation and single-issue campaign.
